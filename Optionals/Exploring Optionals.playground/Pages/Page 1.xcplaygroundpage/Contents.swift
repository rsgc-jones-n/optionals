## Variable initialization

What is the difference between an optional String and a regular String?

Try typing the following code into the playground:

![declare-no-value](declare-no-value.png)

What is the result?

*/
var myName : String?
print (myName)
/*:

Now try typing the following:

![declare-with-value](declare-with-value.png)

How does the result differ?

*/
var yourName : String?
print(yourName)
//: [Next](@next)
